## Chess tournament pairing app
A small program that generates pairings for a chess tournament. Intended for informal settings (e.g., chess clubs, inter-school tournaments).

Pairings are optimized based on a set of criteria, with the following priority:

Two players should not be paired in the same team;
Two players should not be paired together more than once;
Opponents should have similar rankings;
